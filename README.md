# Breast-Cancer-Recurrence-with-SAS-EM
#The data given is the breast cancer reoccurrence data given by the Oncology Institute. It includes 201 instance of no-recurrence-events and 85 instances of recurrence-events. 
#There are various parameters such as age, tumor size, Deg-malig (Tumor Histological grade) and etc that can potentially be used as features in our predictive analysis. 
#The objective of this project is to analyze the dataset and develop a predictive model to predict the recurrence of breast cancer.
